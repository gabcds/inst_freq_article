abstract = {This paper proposes a method to resample the signal against the angle by using the acceleration signal of a gearbox. Firstly, the method is presented. Gear tooth pairs produce contact shocks during rotation. These shocks are processed in order to retrieve the position of the gear against the time. Next, interpolation enables us to estimate the acceleration in angular domain. Secondly, a comparison with other order tracking method is made. It is concluded that our method is cheap but necessitate a low speed fluctuation. Finally, the resampling process is illustrated and detailed step-by-step in the application section.}

abstract = {Fault diagnosis of gearbox at an early stage is very important to avoid catastrophic failures. Condition indicators (CI) are used to quantify the level of vibration generated by the defected gears. A comprehensive comparison of various CIs, i.e., RMS, kurtosis, crest factor, FM0, FM4, M6A, NB4, energy ratio, NA4, energy operator and two new proposed condition indicators (PS-I and PS-II), have been performed for no crack, initial crack and advanced crack for different fluctuating profiles of input speed. This comparative analysis shows the responsiveness of indicators towards crack detection. Limited speed fluctuations and instantaneous high speed fluctuations are considered. Results suggest that newly proposed condition indicators are more robust, stable and effective towards crack detection under fluctuating profiles of speed. A modified time synchronous averaging (MTSA) is also proposed to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).}

author = {P.D. McFadden},
abstract = {An existing technique for the signal processing of the time domain average of the tooth meshing vibration of gears is examined with application to the early detection of failure. It is shown that the “regular” signal extracted from the time domain average of the gear vibration by the elimination of all except the fundamental and harmonics of the tooth meshing frequency forms the time domain average of the vibration of a single tooth. The “residual” signal which is obtained by subtracting the regular signal from the original time domain average gives the departures of the vibration from the average. Numerical and practical examples are given.}
