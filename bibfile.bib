abstract = {This paper proposes a method to resample the signal against the angle by using the acceleration signal of a gearbox. Firstly, the method is presented. Gear tooth pairs produce contact shocks during rotation. These shocks are processed in order to retrieve the position of the gear against the time. Next, interpolation enables us to estimate the acceleration in angular domain. Secondly, a comparison with other order tracking method is made. It is concluded that our method is cheap but necessitate a low speed fluctuation. Finally, the resampling process is illustrated and detailed step-by-step in the application section.}

abstract = {Fault diagnosis of gearbox at an early stage is very important to avoid catastrophic failures. Condition indicators (CI) are used to quantify the level of vibration generated by the defected gears. A comprehensive comparison of various CIs, i.e., RMS, kurtosis, crest factor, FM0, FM4, M6A, NB4, energy ratio, NA4, energy operator and two new proposed condition indicators (PS-I and PS-II), have been performed for no crack, initial crack and advanced crack for different fluctuating profiles of input speed. This comparative analysis shows the responsiveness of indicators towards crack detection. Limited speed fluctuations and instantaneous high speed fluctuations are considered. Results suggest that newly proposed condition indicators are more robust, stable and effective towards crack detection under fluctuating profiles of speed. A modified time synchronous averaging (MTSA) is also proposed to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).}

abstract = {An existing technique for the signal processing of the time domain average of the tooth meshing vibration of gears is examined with application to the early detection of failure. It is shown that the “regular” signal extracted from the time domain average of the gear vibration by the elimination of all except the fundamental and harmonics of the tooth meshing frequency forms the time domain average of the vibration of a single tooth. The “residual” signal which is obtained by subtracting the regular signal from the original time domain average gives the departures of the vibration from the average. Numerical and practical examples are given.}

However, noise emissions from rotating blades can be a challenge for the certification of these new vehicles. The acoustic sources from a propeller can be decomposed into deterministic and random components. Therefore, academic research has focused on developing methods to separate these components. This study compares the performance of several literature methods to decompose propeller noise signals into tonal and broadband components. Initially, the methods were applied to a synthetic data that represents the main characteristics of rotating blade noise. Later, the methods were tested on realistic acoustic data collected within an isolated propeller test rig. The results showed that methods based on phase-averaging the recorded signals satisfactorily detected harmonic components. The method based on cross-correlation between data blocks had good ability to extract the broadband spectra, while poor performance on harmonic detection was observed. Additionally, the wavelet transform and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition methods were capable of reconstructing the time series related to both deterministic and random parts. However, further investigation is required regarding the POD modes separation, as unexpected trends were observed with the wavelet-based method. }

    abstract = { Commercial aircraft electrification and novel urban air mobility vehicles under development have brought renewed interest in propeller noise to the research community. The complex noise generation mechanisms and broad range of possible configurations lead to the development of a large number of propeller noise test rigs. However, the effects of test rig configuration, installation, and instrumentation on the experimental results are still unclear. In this work, the comparison of the results obtained by two different institutes, the Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil) and TU Delft (The Netherlands), is presented.A pair of identical propellers, used for acoustic benchmark studies, were tested under the same conditions to compare the effects of the test rigs on the noise results. A good agreement is observed for thrust and torque. Some divergences on the acoustic data were observed. However, good agreement was noted at the first harmonic and overall sound pressure level, with a maximum difference of 1.8 and 2.8 dB, respectively. }
